    <h2>Lesson One: Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to coding there are mutliple data types that are prevelant in every language.
            Data types are just labels assigned to variables that classify what value a certain piece of
            code can take. They are a pillar of coding and provide an important distinction when working
            with your variables. In the following sections we will break down the most fundamental data 
            types that you need to code.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="int">
        <h3>Integers</h3>
        <p>
            We will first look at the most basic and most used data type across all of programming. This
            of course would be an integer or an int for short. An integer is a whole number that can either
            be positive or negative. Integers have a range of -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647. These will
            be the main data type when it comes to dealing with numbers for the majority of your coding journey.
            
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="string">
        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>
            Coding is known to be linked with numbers and math, but what do we do when we want to attribute
            value to words or a sentence. That's when strings come into play allowing you to use characters and
            words when coding your projects. Strings will typically will be encased in either a double quotation ""
            or in a single quatation ''.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="float">
        <h3>Floats</h3>
        <p>
            Floats are simpler to understand as they are used to represent decimals. With integers we saw
            that only whole numbers were allowed so floats allow you to use partial numbers. Floats typically
            have a range of 1.175494351 E-38 to 3.402823466 E+38. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="boolean">
        <h3>Booleans</h3>
        <p>
            In coding there are times where you need something to be true or false. That is exactly what booleans
            allow you to do. They only take two responses which of course are either true or false. This mainly
            comes into play when you are dealing with loops or conditions. Booleans allow you to set a condition or
            loop while something is true/false and stop while something is true/false.
        </p>
