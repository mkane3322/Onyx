    <h2>Lesson One: Variables and Data Types</h2>

        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to coding there are mutliple data types that are prevelant in every language.
            Data types are just labels assigned to variables that classify what value a certain piece of
            code can take. They are a pillar of coding and provide an important distinction when working
            with your variables. In the following sections we will break down the most fundamental data 
            types that you need to code.

        <h3>Integers</h3>
        <p>
            We will first look at the most basic and most used data type across all of programming. This
            of course would be an integer or an int for short. An integer is a whole number that can either
            be positive or negative. Integers have a range of -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647. These will
            be the main data type when it comes to dealing with numbers for the majority of your coding journey.
