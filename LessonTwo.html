        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to coding you are bound to deal with repitition. Rather than writing something over
            and over again you can use what we call a loop. Loops allow you to set parameters that when fulfilled
            will complete the task until the parameter isn't fulfilled.
