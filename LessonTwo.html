    <h2>Lesson Two: Loops and Syntax</h2>
    <div class="loops">
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to coding you are bound to deal with repitition. Rather than writing something over
            and over again you can use what we call a loop. Loops allow you to set parameters that when fulfilled
            will complete the task until that parameter isn't fulfilled. There are many different types of loops that 
            you will learn about in the coming sections. These types can be can applied through different situations
            based on what you want your code to do.

    <div class="while">
        <h3>While Loop</h3>
        <p>
            The first loop that we will be looking at is the while loop. This loop is the simplest to understand
            as it will run while the parameter is being fulfilled. The parameter will be put in parenthese after 
            declaring the loop. There is a specific syntax associated with the parameters that you can set. You can 
            include these as a connector as represented below.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic syntax of a while loop can be written as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            while (parameter) {

            }
        </p>
    </div>
