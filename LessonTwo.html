    <h2>Lesson Two: Loops and Syntax</h2>
    <div class="loops">
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to coding you are bound to deal with repitition. Rather than writing something over
            and over again you can use what we call a loop. Loops allow you to set parameters that when fulfilled
            will complete the task until that parameter isn't fulfilled. There are many different types of loops that 
            you will learn about in the coming sections. These types can be can applied through different situations
            based on what you want your code to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each loop can have multiple parameters that can be connected through conditions that you set.
            These are common like 'or', 'and', '=', '+', and '-'. These will aid in specifying what you want
            your loop condition to be. These conditions will vary from language to language but will follow
            the same rules. Use these conditions as tools when dealing with your loops and their parameters.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="while">
        <h3>While Loop</h3>
        <p>
            The first loop that we will be looking at is the while loop. This loop is the simplest to understand
            as it will run while the parameter is being fulfilled. The parameter will be put in parenthese after 
            declaring the loop. There is a specific syntax associated with the parameters that you can set. You can 
            include these as a connector as represented below.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic syntax of a while loop can be written as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            while (parameter) {}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="for">
        <h3>For Loops</h3>
        <p>
            There will come a time where you want a loop to only run for a set number of iterations. The
            best loop to use for this circumstance is a for loop. This differs from the while loop as you will
            declare a variable for your iterations in the parameters. There are three main parts that are key when
            making a for loop. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first part of a for loop is the declaration. For this most of the time you will declare the variable
            as 'i' and set it equal to 0 or some other number. This will play a part in what number you want your loop
            to start on. You can of course set a different variable name for the declaration, but since this variable will
            be declared within the loop 'i' is simple and effective.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next part in the for loop is the condition. This will set the number of times that your loop will run.
            Genrally you would set your variable i as greater than '>' or lesser than '<' the amount of times you want your
            loop to run before it ends. This part of your loop will be seperated by a semicolon ';' as seen below when the
            syntax is broken down. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The final part in the parameters of a for loop is what you want your loop to do after every iteration. This will
            typically affect what your current i count is after each iteration. This can be achieved in many different ways.
            The most common way would be either 'i++' or 'i--'. When the '++' operator is added to a variable you should see it
            as 'i + 1 = i' and vice versa for 'i--'. This will increase or decrease your iteration count after each run of your
            loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let's put it all together to give you a visual aid of the making of a for loop:
        </p>
        <p>
            for (i = 0 (initialization); i < 0 (condition); i++ (iteration result)) {}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ifelse">
