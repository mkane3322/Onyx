<h1>Foundations of Coding</h1>
<body>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The history of coding can be traced all the way back to the early 19th Century with Charles Babbage.
        In the 1820s the English mathematician created the Difference Machine. This machine was an automated
        mechanical calculator that was a major breajthrough in technology at the time. This invention would
        be expounded upon in 1843 by Ada Lovelace. She used the machine for general application coming to
        the realization that numbers can be a tool for everything. These two pinoneers are the two pinoneers
        of what we know today as coding.

        When we jump the 20th century we see the majorities of the foundations laid for the modern programming
        environment we find in the current day. To start with the some of the early findings of Alan Turing. He
        is most known for cracking the German Engima code during World War II, but he has considerable contributions
        to the fiend of Computer Science itself. This would begin with his idea of a "universal machine" that could
        run programs that he would actualize into the first computer powered by electricity. This would lead to the 
        first programming language being created in the 1940s by Konrad Zuse with Plankalkul. This language was very
        crude and was mainly used to preform repetitive tasks efficiently. This would get the ball rolling during the
        20th century with some of the languages we see today like Pythan and C++. This would all culminate in 1995
        with the creation of Java, Javascript, and PHP.
    </p>
    <p>
        The introduction of said languages led to what is probably the most influential time for programmming in the
        dot com boom. This time period saw the introduction of the World Wide Web being available to the public at large.
        With the web progressivley becoming a norm in many households more resources and learning tools became prevelant.
        This culmination of broad accessability and rescources allowed for the wave of Computer Science we are familiar
        with today.
